    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone, my name is Kiet. Currently, I am studying web design and
      development with the goal of completing it in 7 days. This is an
      interesting challenge and I am eager to explore more about this
      technology. In addition to studying, I have a great passion for
      photography. I love taking pictures of everything around me, from natural
      landscapes to small details that are often overlooked in life. For me,
      each photo is not just a moment but also a story. I often spend my
      weekends walking, finding inspiration and experimenting with new shooting
      angles. In the future, I hope to combine my passion for photography with
      my knowledge of web design to create beautiful and creative websites. I
      look forward to getting to know you and learning from you.
